          "After their father is called into work, two young boys, Walter and
          Danny, are left in the care of their teenage sister, Lisa, and told
          they must stay inside. Walter and Danny, who anticipate a boring day,
          are shocked when they begin playing Zathura, a space-themed board
          game, which they realize has mystical powers when their house is shot
          into space. With the help of an astronaut, the boys attempt to return
          home."
